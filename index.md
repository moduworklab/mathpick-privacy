Last updated: February 15, 2026

Moduwork Lab ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications developed by Moduwork Lab (including but not limited to "MathPick" and "KAIRIS").

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information unless you voluntarily provide it or unless it is required for the specific functionality of the App you are using. Depending on the App and its features, we may request the following permissions:

1.1 Camera & Microphone (e.g., MathPick)
For Apps that involve image recognition or voice commands, we may request access to your device’s camera or microphone.
- **Usage:** To capture images of math problems or convert speech to text.
- **Storage:** Images and audio are processed locally or sent to our AI service provider for immediate analysis and are not permanently stored on our servers.

1.2 User Input Data (e.g., KAIRIS)
For Apps providing fortune-telling, tarot reading, or lottery number generation, we process the text data you input (e.g., questions, concerns).
- **Usage:** To generate AI-based advice or results.
- **Privacy:** Input data is processed anonymously and is not used to identify any individual.

1.3 Location Information (Future Services)
Some of our Apps (e.g., Travel Guides) may request access to your location to provide location-based services (like weather or nearby recommendations). You will be asked for permission before we access this data.

1.4 Financial & Ledger Data (Future Services)
For Apps related to business management or freight ledgers, we may process numerical data you input for calculation purposes. This data is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly opt-in to cloud backup features.

2. Personal Data
We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, residential address, or phone number, except for support inquiries you send to us via email.

3. Third-Party Services
We use trusted third-party services to improve our Apps and generate revenue. These services may collect information used to identify your device.

- **Google AdMob:** Used to display advertisements. AdMob may use device identifiers (Advertising ID) to serve personalized ads.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini):** Used to process complex queries (math, tarot, etc.). Data sent to the AI model is anonymous.

4. Children's Privacy
Our Apps are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our Apps or legal requirements. We advise you to review this page periodically.
